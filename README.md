# Forage-Virtual-Iternship-Project-4

This project from Forage was based on a fictional home goods called Home. Home wants to analyse what the major contributing factors are to the revenue so they can strategically plan for next year. Management also intends to expand the business and is interested in seeking guidance into areas that are performing well so they can keep a clear focus on whatâ€™s working. They would also like to view different metrics based on the demographic information that is available in the data.

The objective that Home has set for the data analytics team is to derive insights that would help evaluate the current business performance and suggest metrics that would enable them to make the decision on expansion.

The analytics team is tasked with:

- Look at total sales, drivers of sales, where the highest sales are coming from.
- Derive extra features such as time series of the revenue data for the year 2011 and the top 10 customers by revenue.
- Consider the top 10 countries which are generating the highest revenue and their quantity sold.
- Looking at all countries and see which regions have the greatest demand for their products
- Extraction of sample data sets using SQL.
- Analysis of sample data sets with visualizations.
- Cleaning the dataset in Excel
